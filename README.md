## How?
Using the Riot API, this app will retrieve information about the current game for the given summoner, and build a single unified JSON (`GET /game/data`) with all the informations you'll need.
Know you know if you should play safe or very agressively. 

## Architecture
Don't forget to set an environment var `RIOT_API_KEY` to use the project (get a key [here](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/api-keys))

Most of the code is in the `lib/` folder.

* `lib/ddragon` contains helpers to deal with the Riot Static Data: champion avatar, champions stats, summoner icons, etc. 
* `lib/handler` contains the actual HTTP handler used by Express to serve your requests. The most interesting one is probably `lib/handler/game/data.js`.
* `lib/helpers` is a set of useful helpers used throughout the code.
* `lib/middleware` is a collection of small composable middlewares used with express
* `lib/models` defines the data model used for persisting data
* `lib/riot-api` communicates with the Riot API. An interesting file in here is `lib/riot-api/request.js`: it will handle all the rate limiting and is used as a low-level library for all requests to the Riot API. It will also cache requests, and serve data from cache. 

## Using locally
You'll need node.js.
Run `npm install`, and `npm test` to make sure everything is correctly setup.

To test locally, simply run `npm start`. You may want to use nodemon instead to hot-reload you changes.
