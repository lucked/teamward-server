# Teamward: League Of Legends game statistics
> This is the server component. The client is [here](https://github.com/neamar/teamward-client).

Get information about your current games:

* Champions you're facing
* Champions mastery score
* Summoner rank
* Is it his main champ?
* Premade information
* Matchup statistics
* And more!

## Credits

Uses http://champion.gg data for matchups.

## Install
Run `npm install`. You'll need a version of node >= 4, and MongoDB.

## How?
Using the Riot API, this app will retrieve information about the current game for the given summoner, and build a single unified JSON (`GET /game/data`) with all the informations you'll need to know if you should play safe or very agressively. 

## Architecture
Don't forget to set an environment variable named `RIOT_API_KEY` to use the project (get a key [here](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/api-keys)).
If you use a production API key, you can set `RIOT_API_KEY_IS_PRODUCTION` to 1 to speed up everything by sending more calls in parralel. Don't do that with a development key, or you'll get banned!

Most of the code is in the `lib/` folder.

* `lib/ddragon` contains helpers to deal with the Riot Static Data: champion avatar, champions stats, summoner icons, etc. 
* `lib/handler` contains the actual HTTP handler used by Express to serve your requests. The most interesting one is probably `lib/handler/game/data.js`.
* `lib/helper` is a set of useful helpers used throughout the code
    - `lib/helper/game` is the main helper for the game data endpoint
    - `lib/helper/roles` will try to ifner role based on summoner spell and usual champion roles
    - `lib/helper/matchups` will return information about a specific matchup
* `lib/middleware` is a collection of small composable middlewares used with express
* `lib/model` defines the data model used for persisting data
* `lib/riot-api` communicates with the Riot API. An interesting file in here is `lib/riot-api/request.js`: it will handle all the rate limiting and is used as a low-level library for all requests to the Riot API. It will also cache requests, and serve data from cache. 
* `lib/worker` contains a list of useful worker. They can be started with `node bin/worker.js`. You may want to run `node bin/both.js` to start the server and all the workers at the same time.

## Using locally
You'll need node.js.
Run `npm install`, and `npm test` to make sure everything is correctly setup.

To test locally, simply run `npm start`. You may want to use nodemon instead to hot-reload you changes.
